**Course:** CS303A – Object-Oriented Programming & Data Structures  
**Institution:** Northeastern Illinois University  

## Project Overview
This project compares input validation in a web application (HTML form)
and a desktop application (JavaFX).

The goal was to validate user-submitted string data using:
- HTML attributes and regular expressions
- Java String methods and JavaFX event handling

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- Regular Expressions (Regex)
- Java
- JavaFX
- String validation methods

## Validation Requirements
- All fields are required
- Name fields accept only letters (minimum 2 characters)
- Phone number format: ###-###-####
- Email format: xxx@xxx.yyy
- Lucky number between 1 and 100
- Date of birth format: m/d/yyyy or mm/dd/yyyy

## Learning Outcomes
- Practiced client-side vs server-side validation
- Applied regex in both HTML and Java
- Implemented error accumulation in JavaFX
- Strengthened understanding of strings and data validation
